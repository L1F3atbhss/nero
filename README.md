# Project Nero

## Overview

**Project Nero** is a Python-based toolkit designed for network scanning and enumeration. The toolkit provides several powerful cyber tools that can help network administrators, penetration testers, and security researchers gather crucial information about their network environment.

Each letter in **Nero** corresponds to a tool that can be run directly from the Python launcher, creating a simple and easy-to-use interface for launching common cyber tools.

### Tools included:
- **Nmap**: A popular network scanner for discovering hosts and services on a computer network.
- **Enum4linux**: A tool for enumerating information from Windows and Linux SMB shares.
- **Rustscan**: A fast, efficient port scanner to quickly find open ports on target hosts.
- **OpenVAS**: A comprehensive vulnerability scanner to detect weaknesses in your network.

---

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS (some tools may require specific configurations).
- **Easy-to-use terminal interface**: Run all tools directly from a simple menu interface.
- **Modular and extendable**: Easily add more tools or modify existing functionality.

## Usage

1. **Run the launcher**:
   After cloning and setting up the tools, navigate to the project folder and run the `nero.py` script:

   ```bash
   python3 nero.py
   ```

2. **Choose a tool**:
   Once the menu appears, choose the tool you want to use:
   - **N**: Nmap (Network Scanner)
   - **E**: Enum4linux (Enumerate SMB Shares)
   - **R**: Rustscan (Fast Port Scanner)
   - **O**: OpenVAS (Vulnerability Scanner)
   - **Q**: Quit the program

3. **Input your target IP**: Each tool will prompt you to enter a target IP or domain. After entering it, the tool will start scanning.

## Example

```bash
Welcome to Project NERO
Network Enumeration Rapid Operations

Choose a tool:
[N] Nmap - Network Scanner
[E] Enum4linux - Enumerate Shares/Users
[R] Rustscan - Fast Port Scanner
[O] OpenVAS - Vulnerability Scanner
[Q] Quit

Select: n
Enter target IP or domain: 192.168.1.1
Starting Nmap scan for 192.168.1.1...
```
